                            <p>By day I am freelance Personal Trainer and Project Manager in the health and wellness sector. My passion for combat sports, personal fitness journey and desire to become healthier, fitter and stronger has ultimately led me to where I am today in my career. I am also a professional Muay Thai fighter.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            However, like many my career and was severely impacted by the pandemic, so I decided to take the opportunity to learn a new skill that would not only challenge me but also diversify my career opportunities. In a world that is now driven by tech this course is the perfect opportunity for me to deep dive into the realms of programming and use my creative and inquisitive traits to learn, network with others add value in new ways.

                            <br>
                            So far the course has been alot harder than I thought it would be, but <b> <i>"the expert in anything was once a beginner."</i></b> Is my mantra for the duration of this course and giving up is not in my DNA. </p>
